1. Fork this repo
2. Edit the hosts file in this directory to point to your own server instead of mine
3. Edit `group_vars/mailserver`
  1. Set the `hostname` to whatever your mail server's hostname is. Ex: mail.example.com
  2. Set the `mailname` to whatever domain you are serving mail for. Ex: example.com
4. Generate dkim keys. To do that, read gen_certs.sh this will be automated in future iterations
5. Put your dkim keys in your DNS records (TODO: elaboreate on this step)
6. Generate SSL keys. To do that, read gen_certs.sh this will be automated in future iterations
7. Get your SSL keys signed by a CA (unless you are using a self-signed cert) and include the signed certificate in `roles/personal-mailserver/files/private/tls/cert.pem`
8. (optional) Set up SPF (left as exercise to the reader)
9. (optional) Make sure rDNS is set up correctly
10. Make sure you can ssh into your server without a password (your public key must be in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file)
10. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml` to deploy
11. For now, the username is hardcoded as "me", so go in and set the password for "me"
12. Make final changes to DNS: change MX records, etc. See example_zonefile for inspiration.
13. Debug any issues, tear your hair out and/or open an issue on this github project for help
